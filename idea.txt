idea:
free alternative to buycraft, that is opensource

how it works:
- on first run, it will setup the mongodb database with a default long and such
- settings like database uri and website url are configured in a config file
- it will use mongodb for the database

store look: https://github.com/RedDuckss/PHP-Vanilla-Buycraft

admin dashboard:
    statistics (monthly revenue, yearly, etc, all based on timestamps)
    packages (use aws for images? or local storage?)
    subscriptions
    hook into paypal / crypto currency
    two factor authentication
    payment lookup
    payment export to json based on date range
    manual package thing
    create multiple admin accounts
    sales
    categories
    coupons
    giftcards
    banning, IP and username/uuid

backend:
    rest api for plugin
